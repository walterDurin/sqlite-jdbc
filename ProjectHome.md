SQLite JDBC is a library for creating and accessing SQLite database files.

Our SQLiteJDBC library, developed as a part of [Xerial project](http://www.xerial.org/), requires no configuration since all native libraries for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and pure-java SQLite, which works in any OS enviroment, are assembled into a single JAR (Java Archive) file. The usage is quite simple; Download our sqlite-jdbc library, then append the library (JAR file) to your class path.
